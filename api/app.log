INFO:root:Session ID: e85c37eb-9320-4e03-9575-52386a982563, AI Response: I'd be happy to help you with that!

To book a table at NDC restaurant for 7:00 pm on January 28, 2024, I'll need to guide you through the process. Since I'm a text-based AI assistant, I don't have direct access to the restaurant's booking system. However, I can provide you with a few options to make a reservation:

**Option 1: Online Booking Platforms**

You can try searching for NDC restaurant on online booking platforms like OpenTable, Bookatable, or ResDiary. If they have an account with these platforms, you can book a table directly through their website or mobile app.

**Option 2: Restaurant's Website**

Visit NDC restaurant's official website and look for a "Book a Table" or "Reservations" section. If they have an online booking system, you can fill out the form with your preferred date, time, and party size.

**Option 3: Phone Call**

You can call NDC restaurant directly to make a reservation over the phone. Make sure to have the date, time, and your contact information ready. You can search for their phone number online or check their website for contact details.

**Option 4: Email or Contact Form**

If you can't find an online booking system or prefer to book via email, you can try sending an email to NDC restaurant or filling out their contact form (if available on their website). Provide your name, contact information, preferred date, time, and party size.

Before making a reservation, I recommend checking the restaurant's availability, dress code, and any specific policies they may have.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or have any questions!

INFO:root:Session ID: c31977b8-1870-43e9-bc03-c2aa9c95fc4f, AI Response: It seems like you're experiencing a database lock issue. This error occurs when multiple processes or threads are trying to access the same SQLite database simultaneously, and one of them has a lock on the database.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

1. **Use a thread-safe connection**: Make sure you're using a thread-safe connection to your SQLite database. You can do this by setting the `check_same_thread` parameter to `False` when creating your database connection:
   ```
   conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db', check_same_thread=False)
   ```

2. **Use a connection pool**: Instead of creating a new connection every time you need to access the database, consider using a connection pool. This way, multiple threads can share the same connection pool, reducing the likelihood of database locks.

3. **Implement retry logic**: Wrap your database operations in a try-except block and implement retry logic to handle the `OperationalError`. This way, if the database is locked, your application can wait for a short period and then retry the operation.

Here's an example of retry logic:
   ```
   import time

   max_retries = 5
   retry_delay = 0.5  # in seconds

   for i in range(max_retries):
       try:
           conn.execute('INSERT INTO application_logs (session_id, user_query, gpt_response, model) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)',
                         (session_id, query_input.question, answer, query_input.model.value))
           break
       except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
           if i < max_retries - 1:
               time.sleep(retry_delay)
               continue
           else:
               raise e
   ```

Remember to adjust the `max_retries` and `retry_delay` variables according to your application's needs.

If none of these solutions work, you might need to consider using a more robust database system that supports concurrent access, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
